This is a small game designed for training fundamental concepts of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The project includes function implementations in JavaScript, the use of constants and conditions, and image animations with CSS keyframes.
The game was inspired by online tutorials â€” and also by my passion for a good barbecue.
The project still needs some improvements, such as a start button, a score counter, and additional gameplay refinements.
